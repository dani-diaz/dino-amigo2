    name: "Chris",
    bio: "Hi, I am Chris. I grew up in a small town in Indianan. I moved to Cincinnati with my wife and we now have a very energetic boy named Oheneba. Outside of school work we spend a lot of time together shopping, parks, and a lot of “dinosaur” walks! I have over seven years of early childhood experience as a lead teacher. My favorite thing about working in education field is the “lightbulb moment.” When a child finally understands or completes  a task they have been working on. I look forward to working with you and your children. I’m excited to be a part of the team!"
